## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- which variables/coefficients provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Vehicle length and ground clearance (as well as intercept) provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 
This also means that vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on mpg.
The intercept being statistically significant means that intercept explains a signifucant amount of variability in the dependent variqable when all independent variables are equal to zero. 
Depending on our dataset, a significant intercept could mean that the significant features(vehicle length and ground clearance) may need scaling or transforming to help imporve the predictive power of the model.

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
If the p value os significant then the null hypothesis is rejected

- Does the linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
